# iRead
A  personal library project aimed to maintain a book pile in your e-library and keeping track of your reading status. Books can be easily added with all of its objects (characteristic information): title, author, number of pages and a brief summary of your takeaway from the contents of the books.
You can also remove books at anytime or update the your status as you progress from "I just bought it" to "Completed" status, with just a click!

Books get added dynamically just like putting a book on some book racks.
As I progress, it will make use of local storage so that users get to store and really have access to their logged entries.
